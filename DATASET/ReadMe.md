# Vulnerable-C
Contains 1665 verified smart contracts of different sizes from Etherscan, ranging from 49 to 2856 LOC.


# Random-C

Durieux et al.[1] created the SB Curated dataset that contains Solidity contracts deployed in the Ethereum network with known vulnerabilities.We used 90 vulnerable contracts
with 5 different vulnerability types, namely- tx.origin usage (18) , integer overflow (7), integer underflow (8), timestamp usage (5), unchecked send (52).
